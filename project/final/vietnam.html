        <p>Vietnam's colonization began in the 19th century when the French established control over the region, leading to the formation of French Indochina in 1887. This colonial period lasted until World War II, during which Japan occupied Vietnam. After the war, Vietnam declared independence from France in 1945, leading to the First Indochina War and ultimately the division of the country into North and South Vietnam. The Vietnam War ensued in the 1960s, ending with the fall of Saigon in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.</p>
